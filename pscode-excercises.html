// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

Enter one number + enter one number 
total number by addition = total combined
print total numbers on screen


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number is divisible by 2 print even
If number is not divisible by the number 2 print odd 


number = int(input ("Enter a number: "))

if(number % 2) == 0:

print ("{0} is even number" .format(number))
else:
print('{0} is odd number".format(number))



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Add 5 seperate numbers
b) Calculate the sum of those five numbers divide by 5
c) What is the minimum number of all five numbers, smallest
c) What is the maximum of all five numbers, largest
d) If less than all others print minimum number, if largest number print maximum


input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

sum = (n1 + n2 +n3 +n4+ n5)/5

min= (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5)

max = (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5)

print minimum number if < all others
print maximum number if > all others
